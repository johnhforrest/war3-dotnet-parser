war3-dotnet-parser
==================

There's a lot of history in this repository so I'm keeping it around for nostalgia.

The C++ version of this application was my first "commercial" piece of software that I wrote in 2009 when Blizzard changed the format of the replay file and broke the existing parser out there. It was terribly inefficient, but it worked and I was again able to track my APM over time in games and in aggregate across games. Unfortunately the source code for that version was lost when my old SVN repository was corrupted prior to me migrating my source code over to GitHub.

The following year I was going to be interning at Microsoft for the summer where C# was a requirement, so I decided that I would re-write the original source code to learn C# and address the inefficiences of the previous implementation. I can't remember exactly where I left off or if the program works in its current form, but to me it is a key moment in my career as a software engineer. I was getting downloads, feature requests, feedback, and all the joy and stress that goes along with launching a product--it's hard to describe what it's like feeling that for the first time out of something you poured a lot of time & energy into.

Huge shoutout to the Warcraft 3 community and statistics enthusiasts. I'm excited to see what comes next now that Blizzard has officially announced [Warcraft 3 Reforged](https://playwarcraft3.com). Lok'tar ogar!
